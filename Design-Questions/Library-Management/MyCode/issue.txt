1. Incorrect parameter passing:
   - Passing structs by value instead of pointer, causing updates to not persist.
   - Methods like TakeBook and ReturnBook modify only local copies.

2. Book status not persisted:
   - book.ChangeBookStatus(Taken) is applied on a value copy, not the real book.

3. User stores pointers to temporary book copies:
   - u.books = append(u.books, &book) stores pointer to a local variable.

4. Incorrect fine calculation:
   - Used time.Duration incorrectly.
   - Subtracting 7 incorrectly.
   - Produces huge fine due to nanoseconds.

5. Parallel arrays (books and date) introduce inconsistency:
   - No guarantee they stay aligned.

6. ReturnDate is never set in Date struct.

7. Library stores Users and Books as values instead of pointers:
   - Causes unnecessary copying and lost updates.

8. PayFine() design flawed:
   - Accepts txnId and bookId even though transaction already contains them.
   - Should simply operate on receiver.

9. Naming collisions and poor naming:
   - BookStatus() conflicts with field name.
   - date field unclear.

10. Missing error handling:
   - Methods return bool instead of meaningful errors.

11. Unexported struct fields:
   - name, email, mobile are unexported and cannot be used outside package.

12. BookID and userID used as strings everywhere without validation.

13. Missing essential Library functions:
   - No GetUserByID, GetBookByID, GetAvailableBooks.

14. Bad modeling: Date should be part of Transaction instead of separate.

15. ReturnBook() does not update book status to Available.

16. Hardcoded transaction ID "txn123":
   - Every fine uses same ID.

17. User-level mutation of Book status:
   - User should not modify book; only library should.

18. ToString() methods unnecessary:
   - Enum conversion can use string(x).

19. Fine calculation happens before marking book status and borrower details.

20. TakeBook() does not validate if user already borrowed same book.

21. ReturnBook() calculates diff > 7 incorrectly:
   - Used raw Duration instead of days.

22. Missing concurrency safety:
   - No mutexes or thread-safe access.

23. Missing defensive checks:
   - User may borrow unlimited books.
   - No maximum book borrowing limit.

24. No separation of concerns:
   - Too much logic inside User instead of Library controlling flow.

25. Not production-ready structure:
   - No interfaces, no error types, no validation.

26. Lack of clear domain boundary:
   - User modifies Book and Date structs directly.

27. Inconsistent naming styles:
   - camelCase vs PascalCase inconsistently used.

28. TakeBook() ignores case where book is already taken by user.

29. No tracking of past borrow history after book is returned.

30. ReturnBook() does not delete or close the active borrow record.
